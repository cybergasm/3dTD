I consulted the code in the following places during this assignment. I specify where throughout
the comments.

### assignment 4 (camera controls)
### assignment 3 (I riped out the shader class)


I had help with specific concepts from:

### Motion blur - lecture; I also read
  http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems3/gpugems3_ch27.html
  
  but decided to do it with the auxilary buffers since I thought it made localized 
  blur easier (and I wasn't going to use them anyway!)
  
### Particle systems - I read this paper a while back (last quarter), and while
  I did not consult it during this project, it did teah me how to do psystems
